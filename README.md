# System

This is not a pretentious project. This is what it is.

This is an ambitious playground kernel. My goals are to learn more about operating-systems, kernel design and computer-architecture.
Feel free to participate to the development. 

Please read the [Get Started](https://github.com/domage-j/system/wiki/Get-Started) guide in the wiki.
