System is a playground kernel. It's a hobby project, with interest on learning
more about micro-kernel and exo-kernel architecture. While I am planning and reaching
small milestones during the year, I am not working full-time on it. More information
about the nature of this project can be found on the [home page](https://github.com/Jadovenn/System/wiki/Home) of the wiki.

There is no pre-build release for the moment. If you feel courageous enough here is where
you can [get started](https://github.com/Jadovenn/System/wiki/Get-Started).
