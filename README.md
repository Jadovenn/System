# Netero Kernel

This is not a pretentious project. This is what it is.

This is an ambitious playground kernel. Design to learn more about operating-systems, kernel design and computer-architecture.
Feel free to contact me if you want to participate to the development on your free time. I am not gonna maintain a project board
since I am alone. If you are skilled that could be good to help, review (just open an issue and be constructive) and design stuff on it. If you do not know anythings 
I can teach you what I know at least...

Only 2 rules:
1 Keep It Stupid and Stupid. 2 If you don't know, just say "I don't know".

# Source Tree

arch/
	containe architecture dependents stuff. First I write everything here.

# Compile It

Their is a makefile, just run make.

# Run It
